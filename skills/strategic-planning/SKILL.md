# Strategic Planning Agent Skill

## Overview
This skill packages the workflow for creating a **Strategic Planning Agent** inside OpenClaw. The agent assists the user in:
1. Clarifying high‑level objectives and key results (OKRs).
2. Collecting relevant information (market data, internal metrics, constraints).
3. Generating a structured multi‑phase plan with milestones, owners, and timelines.
4. Setting up periodic check‑ins (heartbeats or cron jobs) to track progress and adapt the plan.

The skill is intentionally **high‑level** – most domain‑specific details are kept in reference files under `references/` so the core SKILL.md stays lightweight.

## Workflow
1. **Initialize** – Prompt the user for the strategic focus (e.g., product launch, cost‑reduction, personal career goal).
2. **Define OKRs** – Use a template (`references/okrs_template.md`) to flesh out objectives and measurable key results.
3. **Gather Data** – Run any required data‑collection skills (weather, web_search, camsnap, etc.) based on the user’s domain.
4. **Draft Plan** – Produce a markdown plan with sections:
   - Goals & Vision
   - Milestones & Timeline
   - Responsibilities
   - Risks & Mitigations
   - KPI tracking
5. **Setup Monitoring** – Create a heartbeat or cron entry (`heartbeat/strategic‑planning.md`) that reminds the user to update progress.
6. **Iterate** – On each heartbeat, the agent can call `sessions_spawn` to run sub‑agents that update the plan with new data.

## When to Use
- The user asks to *plan* a project, initiative, or personal goal.
- The user wants a *structured* roadmap rather than a free‑form brainstorm.
- The user wants regular *progress checks* automatically scheduled.

## References (loaded on demand)
- `references/okrs_template.md` – OKR markdown template.
- `references/plan_example.md` – Example strategic plan for a product launch.
- `references/data_sources.md` – Suggested data‑collection skills per domain.

## Extending the Skill
If you need additional domain‑specific data, add more files under `references/` and update the **When to Use** section to mention them.
